# Nebulous serverless apps demonstrating use of non-Cloud Google APIs
### Python (2 and 3) versions

These apps are Python 2 & 3 compatible and work on all Cloud serverless platforms like the other sample apps in this repo. The apps and their corresponding codelabs are linked below.

The apps default to a Python 3 setup. If you wish to use Python 2 instead, there may be additional steps required. See the [Cloud API Python sample in the other folder](../cloud/python) which defaults to Python 2.
